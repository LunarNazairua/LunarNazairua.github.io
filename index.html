                My name is Lunar Nazairua, or just Nazairua for short and Naz if you want to go even shorter. I am a sophmore in high school who is trying to become a civil or mechanical enginner and a
                small content creator on the side when ever I feel like making content. This site will be about some of my favorite things, Animes, Content Creators, Animals, Vtubers, Music, my pets,
                and my hobbies. Below is a gallery of everything, most have an Image and description but some may not, ENJOY!

                        I really like to read books in my spare time, I currently plan to buy and read the Song of Ice and Fire Series. I like reading books that are longer because that means I have
                        more to read and the story can be flushed out more. Though not all books are good or capture my intrest, I still read the books I buy since I am cuorius as to what they have
                        in store. I am also starting to build a mini library in my own room, which is cool!

                        I am a verified coffee addict, I drionk 2-3 cups of coffee everyday of the week, month, and year. I either make my own or go the corner store/Bakery to get me a nice
                        warm cup of coffee in the morning. It also acts as a really effective laxative.
