                    <article>
                        I really like to read books in my spare time, I currently plan to buy and read the Song of Ice and Fire Series. I like reading books that are longer because that means I have
                        more to read and the story can be flushed out more. Though not all books are good or capture my intrest, I still read the books I buy since I am cuorius as to what they have
                        in store. I am also starting to build a mini library in my own room, which is cool!

                        I am a verified coffee addict, I drionk 2-3 cups of coffee everyday of the week, month, and year. I either make my own or go the corner store/Bakery to get me a nice
                        warm cup of coffee in the morning. It also acts as a really effective laxative.

                    <article>
                        I tend to get distracted easily when doing schpool work or homework, and one of my favorite distractions are Marbles. They roll around and you are able to hit them so
                        they fal off the table and then you spend a few minutes looking for them and then you keep hitting them. I swaer sometimes I act like a cat because of how I get distracted.

                    <article>
                        The manga was extreamlly good, and to see the silliness be animated is so amazing. They capture the vide of the manga perfectly, its one of the best anime adaptations in
                        my opinion. I am still reading the manga but once I get to the end I'll continue watching the Anime since I only watched Episode 1 currently.
